# MongoDB Aggregation Error Handling and `$unwind`

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines, specifically concerning the `$unwind` operator and robust error handling. The provided code snippet showcases a potential failure scenario and a solution for improved reliability.

## Problem

The `$unwind` operator can fail silently or throw errors if it attempts to unwind a field that does not exist. This often happens when `$lookup` returns no matching documents.  The original code lacks comprehensive error handling, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The improved code implements robust error handling and adds checks to mitigate the `$unwind` issue.  The addition of `$lookup`'s `let` and `pipeline` features enhance the query's flexibility and efficiency.
